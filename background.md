In life, she was a professional. Hard-working, energetic, and always whistling a tune, she had a way of brightening up any room while simultaneously imbuing all others present with a renewed motivation to get some work done.

Most others knew her by her first name, but to you, she was "Grandma."

Before she passed, she interviewed with a young tech startup company who was promising to develop a product that could capture a person's whole essence and allow them to live on indefinitely in silicon. You have your doubts about this idea. Could they truly capture a living consciousness in a machine? Or would we be fooling ourselves with near-perfect imitations of consciousness? You may get the chance to find out sooner than you thought.

After your Grandmother's last wishes were read, you were shocked to discover that she left you to inherit her "Essence," as it was branded. To you, it looks like a small computer with a screen, a speaker and microphone, and some wheels. Not much like a Grandma at all. That was, until she said, "Don't look so sad, child. All will be well again. I'll just need your help with a few things."
